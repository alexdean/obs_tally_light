# Peace UCC

This is a collection of scripts and utilities I use to help manage live web
broadcasts for [Peace UCC](https://www.peaceucc.org) in Duluth, Minnesota.

## Tally Lights

A combination of OBS python scripting and arduino+wifi devices we use to indicate
which camera is live at any given time.

## Scene & Transition Importers

We set up a lot of new OBS scenes every week. These scripts speed up the process
by allowing us to create new scenes from a common template.
